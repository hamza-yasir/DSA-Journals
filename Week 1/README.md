# DSA Week 1 Concept Revision

This repository contains C++ programs covering various examples and exercises related to file handling, class structures, templates, and object-oriented programming.

## Project Structure

- **`source.cpp`** – Contains all examples and exercises (1.1 to 1.7) implemented in C++.
- **`fin.txt`** – Sample input file used for file reading operations.
- **`fout.txt`** – Output file generated by the program for storing processed data.
- **`students.txt`** – Input file containing student records for calculating averages.

## Features
- Reads student data from `students.txt`, calculates average scores, and displays statistics.
- Implements file handling for reading/writing (`fin.txt` and `fout.txt`).
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts with `Student` and `House` classes.
- Uses C++ templates to create a sequence handling class (`MySequence`).
- Overloads operators for complex number calculations.

Exercises & Examples Overview
---
Example 1.1

Demonstrates function overloading with different ways to find the maximum of two numbers.

Example 1.2

Introduces function templates to determine the maximum of two values of any data type.

Example 1.3

Uses function templates to compare and return the maximum value among different data types.

Example 1.4

Implements a template class mypair to store two values and return the maximum or minimum.

Example 1.5

Defines a House class that allows users to enter and display house details, showcasing object-oriented principles.

Example 1.6

Demonstrates file handling by copying content from one file to another while counting characters, words, and sentences.

Example 1.7

Reads student data from input.dat, calculates weighted averages, and writes the output to output.dat.

Exercise 1.1

Implements a Complex class for basic operations on complex numbers, including addition and multiplication.

Exercise 1.2

Enhances the mypair template class by adding a function to return the minimum of two values.

Exercise 1.3

Utilizes function templates to determine the maximum value of two numbers of any type.

Exercise 1.4

Extends file handling operations by reading and writing text data while tracking content statistics.

Exercise 1.5

Implements a House class for storing and displaying house-related details.

Exercise 1.6

Defines a Student class to process student marks from a file, compute averages, and display statistics.


## Sample Input (students.txt)
```
3 5
John Doe 85 90 78 92 88
Hamza 75 80 85 90 95
ukasha 90 85 88 92 86
```

## Sample Output
```
Name         Average Score
-----------------------------------
Kashf     Avg: 86.6
Hamza   Avg: 85.0
Ukasha  Avg: 88.2

Overall Class Average: 86.6
Highest Average Score: 88.2
Lowest Average Score: 85.0
```

## Notes
- Ensure you update `students.txt` with the correct format before running.
- Ensure text files are in the same directory as source.cpp before execution.
